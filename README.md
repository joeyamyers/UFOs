# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose
The goal of this project is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. I provided a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to filtering based on the date, users will be able to add filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the ufo.
